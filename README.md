# csv_parser_learn_TS
CSV parser demo. OOP learning project in TypeScript, different paradigms.

This code uses TypeScript and Deno for reading and writing files:

https://deno.land/

(but can be easily rewritten for NodeJS)
Therefore the code won't run in a browser because it needs full file access.

This learning project is part of a Udemy course:
"Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide [2020] by Stephen Grider"

My source code is based on that course but I've modified it a lot.
