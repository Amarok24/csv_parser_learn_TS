------------------

running DENO instead of Node

In DENO all imports need to have a valid filename with extension (like in vanilla JS), for example:
import { Sorter } from "./Sorter.ts";

DIRECTLY RUN A .TS FILE
deno run --no-check src/index.ts

FROM DENO DOCS:
When using deno run, deno test, deno cache, or deno bundle you can specify the --no-check flag to disable TypeScript type checking. This can significantly reduce the time that program startup takes. This can be very useful when type checking is provided by your editor and you want startup time to be as fast as possible


using tsconfig.json for Deno
deno run --no-check -c tsconfig.json src/index.ts
